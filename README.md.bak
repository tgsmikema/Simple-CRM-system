To run the project:

1) Setup the MySQL database:

	a) download MySQL workbench for Windows
	
	b) setup localhost server username and password.
	
	c) run the "setup_local_MySQL_database.sql" file to setup the database.
	
	d) update "databaseConfig.txt" while the first line is jdbc connection string
	, second line is username and the third line is password.

2) Run the project from eclipse IDE:


	a) external libraries required: 
		1. JavaFX
		2. javax.mail
		3. org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils
		4. mysql-connector-java-8.0.27.jar
		5. opencsv-5.5.2.jar
	
	b) VM arguments: 
	--module-path "path of javafx library" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
	
	c) keep the file structure, do not delete any file.
	
	
	
	
3) Run the jar file:

	a) make sure place the jar file inside the top level of the project folder.
		(when you download the file, it should automatically be in the correct hirarchy).

	b) open command line app on your windows machine. (ie.  cmd.exe)
		
		1) type `java -version` into the cmd, if your java version is below 17, then please
		update your java runtime to version 17, otherwise it is prone to errors.
		
		2) once you confirm that your java version is at least version 17, then change the current directory
		to the project folder top level (ie. where the .jar file is located).
		
		3) enter `java --module-path "path of javafx library" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar crm.jar`
		to run the project. (replace the location to your javafx library with path in the quote above)
